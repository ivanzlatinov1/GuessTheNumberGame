## Installation
To run the game, you need to have integrated development environment (VS, VS Code, Python) installed on your system. Then you can **clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GuessTheNumberGame.git
   cd GuessTheNumberGame
   ```

## How to play
Start by putting a number in the console app, and see the console response after it. If you are close to the number, it will display to you 'Higher' or 'Lower'. But if your guess is 30+ numbers away from the AI's number choice, the program is going to display 'Too far! Go higher/lower'.

## Interactive Gameplay
This is a simple command-line interface with clear prompts and feedback. Also supported options for continuing the game after typing 'yes' when the program asks if you want to play again or ending the game by typing 'no'.
